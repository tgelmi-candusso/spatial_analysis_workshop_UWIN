#  Spatial data  

Spatial data is any type of data that directly or indirectly references a specific geographical area or location. These can be, for example, geographic features on the landscape or environmental properties of an area such as temperature or air quality.

Spatial data can be continuous or discrete just like regular data, and in both cases it can be represented as a **vector** or a **raster**. Vector data uses points and lines to represent spatial data, while raster data represents data in a grid of pixels where each pixel/cell represents a specific geographic location and the information therein. Raster data will be heavily influenced by the size of the pixels/cells, i.e. resolution.

![Figure showing difference between vectors and rasters](images/vectorvsraster_from_rsgislearn_blogspot_com.png "Vector data"){width=60%} 

## Projections and Spatial Reference Systems (SRS)
Both vector and raster data are planar representations of the world, a 3-dimensional sphere, and as such are not perfect copies. Depending on how the planar representation is created it will distort more or less certain areas of the world. Therefore many representations exist. These are called projections, as the representations project the 3-dimensional spheric image into a planar, 2-dimensional image. Maps with different projections are not comparable and cannot be overlaid. Therefore, we need to make sure we always work on the same projection when using spatial data.

![Figure showing different projectsions of the earth](images/map_projections.png "Vector data"){width=60%} 

To locate points geographic features on a map, you also need a system of coordinates that define the x-y coordinates for every point on the map. The system of latitude and longitude is the most familiar. These coordinate systems can be used to extract area and distance information from maps. 
A combination of a projection and a set of coordinates is known as a **Spatial Reference System (SRS)**. Your choice of SRS will depend on the source of your data and your spatial analysis needs. In general, there is a trade-off between the extent of an SRS and its accuracy for measurement. For example, the WGS84 system of latitude and longitude covers the entire earth, but it is not useful for measurement because degrees of longitude become closer together the closer you are to the poles. Systems based in UTM or State Plane coordinates are much more accurate for measuring distances and areas, but they are only useful for covering specific regions.

To describe SRS systems around the world, every system is given a specific "EPSG code." For example, the familiar system of latitude / longitude has the EPSG code 4326. All GIS software, including spatial mapping functions in R, allow users to transform our spatial data between different SRSs using these EPSG codes.

In summary, every spatial data set comes with two primary considerations:

* Is it in vector or raster format?
* What SRS is it in?

## Setting up to work with spatial data in R
Packages used to read and manipulate data include the `sf` package, which reads a shapefile as a spatial data frame, and the `terra` package that reads the shapefiles as a Spatvector. Previously there was also the `raster` package, but we will try to avoid it as it has been deprecated. We have also included `ggplot2` and the `ggmap` package, which has useful mapping functions on top of `ggplot2`.

```{r load packages, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
```

#  Vector data  

In this section we will read and manipulate vector data in R. 

* Vector data represents real world features within the GIS environment. A feature is anything you can see on the landscape. 
* Vector data is commonly stored as a shapefile and can contain point, line, or polygon data.
* Vector data contains information attached to each feature, which we call attributes.

Features can be points (red) representing specific x,y locations, such as a trees or camera sites; polygons (white) representing areas, such as forests or residential areas; and lines (yellow/green and blue) representing continuous linear features, such as roads or rivers

![Figure showing polygons, points, and lines in the landscape](images/vector_data_image_from_docs_qgis_org.png "Vector data"){width=80%}  

Vector data reads as a data frame would. Each row is a feature and each column is an attribute, and it contains a geometry column where the xy coordinates for the shapes are stored. Plotting these data will plot the points or shapes in the map using the xy coordinates stored for each feature.   

```{r, echo=FALSE}
captures.table <- read.csv("data/captures.csv")
captures.spatial <- st_as_sf(captures.table,
                     coords = c("longitude","latitude"), 
                     crs = 4326)
head(captures.spatial)
```

The output in the section above shows example vector data for points representing captures of wildlife at camera traps. The top of the output describes the data, including the reference system (WGS 84, which is the standard for lat/lon data) and minimum and maximum extent of the data. Each row has attribute data (species, a location ID, and the capture date of that species). The final column stores the spatial data. You can see that it is `POINT` data and the coordinates of each point.

## Vector data: points

In this section, you will learn the following methods for working with point data

1. Importing spatial data that is stored in a CSV file
2. Converting these data to a spatial format
3. Plotting points on a map

Point data can be obtained directly from a shapefile or a csv file where each row is a feature. In this case study, we will work with camera trap site data and the information collected at each site, i.e. point. The camera trap sites here are located in Seattle, and have captured coyote and raccoon presence and absence from the 2019 spring season to the 2021 winter season. The data is stored as a data frame in a csv called `captures.csv`. The next two lines read the data and show the top few lines.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
captures.table <- read.csv("data/captures.csv")
head(captures.table)
```

Although the data you imported has Latitude and Longitude columns, R does not recognize it as "spatial" data. Those two columns could be any numbers, and they just happen to have names that we recognize as referring to geography. Our first job will be to **save these data as a "spatial features data frame."** This is a special type of data frame that has a column in a format that any GIS software will recognize as geographic. This will allow us to observe these points in the map and extract environmental information based on their location. We will use the `st_as_sf()` function from the `sf` package, and we will specify the projection (crs).

This function has three arguments:

  1. our data frame,
  2. `coords`: the names of the columns that hold our coordinates. Note that Longitude comes before latitude. This is because the pattern is x,y, and Longitude is the Earth's x-axis.
  3. `crs`: the Coordinate Reference System.

How do we know which projection our data is in? Because the data are in lat/lon format, they are in the WGS 84 projection, and the EPSG code for this projection is 4326. With other sources of point data, you may need to ask your data provider for the CRS before working with it.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
captures.spatial <- st_as_sf(captures.table,
                     coords = c("longitude","latitude"), 
                     crs = 4326)
head(captures.spatial)
```

With a spatial data frame, you get the same data frame as before with two new things.

  1. Five lines above your data that describe the spatial components of the data frame. Notice the `Geodetic CRS` row that confirms our data are in WGS84 format.
  2. A new column at the end called `geometry`. This is the column that has converted the Latitude and Longitude columns into spatial data we can use in calculations.

\newpage

Let's observe the spatial distribution of the points by plotting them using the `ggplot2` package. The `geom_sf()` function will allow us to plot the spatial data frame object. 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(captures.spatial) + geom_sf()
```

\newpage

We will want to add a reference so we can easily distinguish between locations because for now there is no basemap in this plot. We can use the Google Maps API for this. This tutorial uses an example API key to show the map. If you want to run the code yourself, there are a couple preliminary steps you need to take.

1. Go to [https://developers.google.com/maps](https://developers.google.com/maps)
2. Log in with to your google account if you aren't already.
3. Click the blue "Get started" button.
4. Click "Keys & credentials" on the left.
      * If you have not already registered an account with google's developer platform, you may need to enter credit card information even though your use will likely qualify for the free tier.
5. Under the heading "API Keys," you should have a row for the "Maps API Key." Click "SHOW KEY" on that row and copy this value somewhere. You will use it in the next step.

Once you have a Google Maps API key, you can use it to start a new mapping session with the `register_google()` function.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
my_api <- 'AIzaSyA87eopi57zxCYPv4pVoMI3wco9krqHuTg'
register_google(key = my_api)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_api <- 'ENTER YOUR KEY HERE'
register_google(key = my_api)
```

**If you don't want to mess around with the Google Maps API for this tutorial, skip ahead to [Plotting coyote detections on a map](#coyotemap).**

\newpage

Now we can get a map relevant to our region using the `get_map()` function. This can be done both using a bounding box with coordinate information if we want a specific study area, or just the city's name.

```{r, eval=TRUE,  warning=FALSE}
seattle <- get_map("seattle", source= "google", api_key = my_api)
ggmap(seattle)
```

\newpage

That map looks nice, but it will unfortunately cut off the camera sites at the eastern end of the study area. If we use a bounding box that shows the whole study area, the code will look like this:

```{r, eval=TRUE,  warning=FALSE}
seattle <- get_map(location = c(left = -122.5, bottom = 47.35,
                                right = -121.9, top = 47.8),
                   source ="google", api_key = my_api)
ggmap(seattle)
```

\newpage

Now we can plot our camera site locations on the Seattle map.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
ggmap(seattle) +
  geom_sf(data=captures.spatial, inherit.aes = FALSE)
```

\newpage

### Plotting coyote detections on a map{#coyotemap}

Now lets plot on a map the coyotes captured at each the camera trap sites. We will filter the data based on species name, using the dplyr package, and count detections at each site. We will then plot using the function seen above, but setting point size based on the number of detections at each site.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
coyotes <- filter(captures.spatial, speciesname == "Canis latrans") %>%
  group_by(locationid) %>%
  summarize(detections = n())

ggmap(seattle) +
  geom_sf(data = coyotes, inherit.aes = FALSE, aes(size = detections)) +
  ggtitle("Coyote detections") +
  labs(size = "Detection frequency") +
  scale_size_continuous(breaks=seq(100, 500, by=100))
```

**If you aren't using the Google Maps API, you can replace the second command in that code block with the following. It won't have the basemap, but you will be able to see the relative number of detections in the plot.**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = coyotes, inherit.aes = FALSE, aes(size = detections)) +
  ggtitle("Coyote detections") +
  labs(size = "Detection frequency") +
  scale_size_continuous(breaks=seq(100, 500, by=100))
```

### Try it yourself

See if you can make the same map, but for raccoons. (Solution is hidden below or on the next page in the PDF.)

\newpage

<details closed><summary>Solution</a></summary>

      raccoons <- filter(captures.spatial, speciesname == "Procyon lotor") %>%
            group_by(locationid) %>%
            summarize(detections = n())

      ggmap(seattle) +
            geom_sf(data = raccoons, inherit.aes = FALSE, aes(size = detections)) +
            ggtitle("Raccoon detections") +
            labs(size = "Detection frequency") +
            scale_size_continuous(breaks=seq(100, 500, by=100))

</details>

Now that you've made a simple map with point data, it's time to move on to lines.

\newpage

## Vector data: lines

In this section, you will learn the following methods for working with line data

1. Import line data that is stored in a shapefile
2. Clip a layer to a smaller region
3. Transform data to a different projection
4. Calculate the length of a linear feature
5. Buffer a linear feature

We will look into vector data in the form of lines using the TIGER database for Washington, composed of primary and secondary roads. The spatial object will be read in the same way as we did the points, but in this case we will load directly the shapefile containing the features, downloaded from [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2019-state-washington-primary-and-secondary-roads-state-based-shapefile)

The dataset contains 6 attributes (fields) for each feature. Because the data are already in a spatial format, we use the `st_read()` function from the `sf` package to import the data.

```{r message=FALSE}
roads <- st_read("maps/roads/tl_2019_53_prisecroads.shp")
```

\newpage

Let's plot the dataset to see how it looks. We will only plot one of the attributes, otherwise it will plot one map for each attribute.

```{r}
plot(roads[,1])
```

\newpage

As you can see from the map, our road layer covers the entire state. We would like to narrow it down to our study area. We have coordinates for the boundaries of our study area from the previous section. Unfortunately, the spatial data we are using is not in the right projection to use latitude and longitude values to crop it, so we first need to **transform** the data. This is an essential step in nearly any spatial analysis, so you will become very familiar with the `st_transform()` function.

```{r}
roads.lat <- st_transform(roads,crs="EPSG:4326")
```

We crop to the same dimensions as the bounding box from the previous section with `st_crop()`. The function arguments are slightly different than the `ggmap` function (e.g., "xmin" instead of "left") but the numbers are the same. 

```{r}
roads.clip <- st_crop(roads.lat, xmin = -122.5, ymin = 47.35,
                                 xmax = -121.9, ymax = 47.8)
```

Although the WGS84 CRS is widely useful, we are going to convert our data to a different CRS for the rest of the analysis. The CRS we will use is the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) for Zone 10, which covers a strip from the equator to the north pole, including the state of Washington. Its CRS code is 26910. It has two primary advantages over WGS84:

1. It allows more precise calculations over short distances
2. Its units are in meters.

```{r}
roads <- st_transform(roads.clip, crs="EPSG:26910")
```

Now that we have the roads data cropped and in units of meters, we can estimate the length of these roads, which will come in handy when estimating road density in a certain area. The `st_length()` function from the `sf` package estimates the length of each road.

```{r}
roads$length <- st_length(roads)
head(roads)
```

Notice that the unit `[m]` is printed in the column. We can convert to numeric if we don't want the unit directly in the column using `as.numeric()`

```{r}
roads$length <- as.numeric(roads$length)
```

You can estimate total length for each road type, or any other attribute, with the `aggregate()` function.

```{r}
road_lengths <- aggregate(length ~ RTTYP, data=roads, FUN="sum")
print(road_lengths)
```

Sometimes it is useful to convert lines to polygons, for example when we want a better representation of the area a linear feature occupies. This might be good for connectivity analysis as road width might define crossing probability or for considering impervious surface generated by roads. For this we use the `st_buffer()` function and decide a buffer size we will use for the linear feature expansion. Notice that the "Geometry type" for our layer is now `POLYGON`, which is the subject of the next section.

```{r}
roads_p <- st_buffer(roads, dist=12) # buffer to 12 meters
plot(roads_p[,1])
head(roads_p)
```

\newpage

## Vector data: polygons

In this section, you will learn the following methods for working with polygon data

1. Import polygon data that is stored in a shapefile
2. Transform data to a different projection
3. Calculate the area of a polygon feature

Polygon data are data that delimit an area. The shape of this area might represent specific physical features, such as buildings, or it might delimit an area with similar characteristics, for example residential areas, parks, or forest.

We can read a polygon dataset, like points and lines, with either the `sf` package or the `terra` package. The main difference is only the speed at which certain processes happen, but most functions are found in equivalent versions in both packages. For this section, you will perform the same set of operations with both packages. We have pre-pended `sf::` to all functions from `sf` and `terra::` to all functions from `terra` to make their source clear. This isn't necessary for using the function, but it will make which package you are using more clear.

### Polygons with `sf`

Just like with lines, we use `st_read` to import a shapefile. We will import a layer of forest cover across the study area. This layer was originally downloaded from Open Street Map and has been filtered for forest layers and cropped to the study area extent.

```{r}
forest_sf <- sf::st_read("maps/Seattle_forest.shp")
```

\newpage

To view the data, use the `plot` function. To avoid making one map for each feature, plot just the first attribute.

```{r}
plot(forest_sf[,1])
```

Let's see what CRS these data are plotted in. Look for the row with `"EPSG"` in it.

```{r}
sf::st_crs(forest_sf)
```

Because this is in WGS 84 / EPSG:4326, we need to transform it to EPSG:26910.

```{r}
forest_sf <- sf::st_transform(forest_sf,crs="EPSG:26910")
```

Finally, we're going to calculate the area of each polygon in the dataset, append that value to the data frame in a new column called `area`, and calculate the total area of forest cover in the extent of the study area. Because our data are in a projection in meters, the values we obtain will be in m^2, so we will also convert the area to km^2 by dividing by 1000000.

```{r}
forest_sf$area <- as.numeric(sf::st_area(forest_sf) / 1000000)
sum(forest_sf$area)
```

### Polygons with `terra`

Now you can perform the same sequence using the functions in `terra`.

```{r}
forest_terra <- terra::vect("maps/Seattle_forest.shp")
```

When we plot a Spatvector from terra, we don't need to specify one attribute. It draws only one map regardless.

```{r}
plot(forest_terra)
```

Re-project to EPSG 26910.

```{r}
terra::crs(forest_terra)
forest_terra <- terra::project(forest_terra,"EPSG:26910")
```

Calculate the area of forest cover.

```{r}
forest_terra$area <- as.numeric(terra::expanse(forest_terra) / 1000000)
sum(forest_sf$area)
```

## Raster data

In this section, you will learn the following methods for working with raster data

1. Import raster data and re-project it
2. Crop a raster based on another spatial data layer
3. Combine multiple rasters into one stack
4. Perform calculations with rasters

We will focus on three raster datasets, two numerical rasters: Normalized Vegetation density index (NDVI), downloaded directly from [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), and the global human settlement building density layer  [GHSL](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/download.php). We will also use one categorical raster: a land use / land cover map from [the 2008 USGS Land Cover Database](https://www.mrlc.gov/data/nlcd-2008-land-cover-conus), which categorizes the landscape into several categories for developed area and natural areas.

We have previously cropped these rasters in order to keep only Washington state and speed up the computational process.

To load the rasters we use the `rast()` function from the `terra` package.

```{r}
NDVI <-rast("maps/NDVI_WA.tif")
BUILT <- rast("maps/BUILT_WA.tif")
LULC <- rast("maps/LULC_WA.tif")
```

We will directly reproject the rasters to a common projection. Be patient: the land use layer takes a little while to re-project.

```{r}
NDVI <- project(NDVI, "EPSG:26910")
BUILT <- project(BUILT, "EPSG:26910")
LULC <- project(LULC, "EPSG:26910")
```

We will further crop the Washington state layer to the extent of our study area using one of the layers we created in the previous section as a cookie-cutter. Let's use the forest layer we extracted from OSM read as a Spatvector.

```{r}
NDVI_c <- crop(NDVI, forest_terra)
BUILT_c <- crop(BUILT, forest_terra)
LULC_c <- crop(LULC, forest_terra)
```

\newpage

```{r}
plot(NDVI_c)
```

\newpage

```{r}
plot(BUILT_c)
```

\newpage

The first two rasters contain numerical data only -- each cell describes a quantity that is measurable on a continuous scale. Each value in the land use data, on the other hand, corresponds to a specific type of cover based on [this legend](https://www.mrlc.gov/data/legends/national-land-cover-database-class-legend-and-description). Because our data also has the auxilliary file `LULC_WA.tif.aux.xml`, we can automaticaly see the translation between the numerical values in the raster and their corresponding category names. If we didn't have this file, there are methods to classify raster data into categories, although that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

```{r}
plot(LULC_c)
```

\newpage

When we are dealing with many rasters, we can stack them together and apply functions directly to all of them, but first they have to perfectly match in terms of extent. We will first project one using another as a cookie-cutter and then stack. We will stack the numerical rasters only for now and rename them.

```{r}
NDVI_c <- project(NDVI_c, BUILT_c)

#now we can stack them
stack <- c(NDVI_c, BUILT_c)
names(stack) <- c("NDVI","BUILT")
plot(stack)
```

\newpage

With rasters we can also do math, the function will be applied to each cell against each overlaying cell. For example if we substract building density from vegetation density. This technique is useful for comparisons among similar rasters, for example comparing NDVI between two time periods.

```{r}
stack_diff <- NDVI_c - BUILT_c
plot(stack_diff)
```

\newpage

If we want to have more control over the map and add more layers, we can use `ggplot`. To plot a raster with `ggplot`, we first need to convert the raster to a data frame. The `xy=TRUE` argument when we create the data frame saves the coordinates of each pixel in the raster.

```{r}
LULC_df <- as.data.frame(LULC_c, xy=TRUE)
names(LULC_df) <- c("x","y","LandCover")
ggplot(LULC_df) +
  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = LandCover))
```

Yikes! That's probably not what you were hoping for. The downside of converting our data to a data frame is that we lost our nice color scheme for the categories. We will need to recreate that color map as a data table. We've looked up the colors from the original map and created a new data table that identifies the correct color for each land cover category.

```{r}
lulc_colors <- data.frame(LandCover = c("Open Water", "Perennial Ice/Snow", 
                                        "Developed, Open Space", "Developed, Low Intensity", 
                                        "Developed, Medium Intensity", 
                                        "Developed, High Intensity", 
                                        "Barren Land (Rock/Sand/Clay)", "Deciduous Forest", 
                                        "Evergreen Forest", "Mixed Forest", "Shrub/Scrub", 
                                        "Grassland/Herbaceous", "Pasture/Hay", "Cultivated Crops", 
                                        "Woody Wetlands", "Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands"),
                          color = c("#466B9F", "#D1DEF8", "#DEC5C5", "#D99282",
                                    "#EB0000", "#AB0000", "#B3AC9F", "#68AB5F", 
                                    "#1C6330", "#B5C58F", "#CCBA7C", "#E3E3C2", 
                                    "#CACA78", "#E8D1D1", "#DCD93D", "#A8EBEB"))
color_map <- setNames(lulc_colors$color,lulc_colors$LandCover)
```

We'll save our map this time before printing it.

```{r}
lulc_map <- ggplot(LULC_df) +
  geom_raster(aes(x = x, y = y, fill = LandCover)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = color_map)
lulc_map
```

\newpage

We can plot the coyote detections on to our map.
```{r}
lulc_map +
  geom_sf(data = coyotes, inherit.aes = FALSE, aes(size = detections)) +
  ggtitle("Coyote detections") +
  labs(size = "Detection frequency") +
  scale_size_continuous(breaks=seq(100, 500, by=100)) +
  xlab("UTM E") + ylab("UTM N")
```

Oh no! What happened? If you squint, you can see a tiny map of Seattle in the upper right corner. This happened because our coyote layer is still in WGS 84, but the land use map is in UTM Zone 10N. The important point here is that if your projections don't line up, you may still get a result, but it won't be at all what you expect. Let's re-project the coyote data then recreate this map so it looks nice. Try those two steps yourself before checking the answer in the space below (web) or the next page (PDF).

# Case study: Extracting map data for camera trap analysis

This section will pull everything together. You will use some of the layers from the previous parts of the tutorial to extract environmental covariates then build models using your detection data. This case study shows how integrating your spatial analysis into R allows you to perform a complete analysis in one setting instead of bouncing back and forth between GIS and R.

In this section you will do the following:

1. Import data for a spatial analysis
2. Get all your data layers into the same projection
3. Buffer a camera trap site
4. Extract environmental covariates from this buffer
5. Run a simple regression model with camera data

For this section we will use the points dataset representing the camera trap sites, and the geospatial data in the vector and raster section, to extract the geospatial data relevant to each camera trap site. Some of the steps in the next section are redundant to work you did earlier in the tutorial, but we wanted to put everything in this case study that you would need to perform the analysis from start to finish but with fewer explanatory details.

We will first generate a buffer polygon for each camera site, with radius 500m from the camera trap location. For each camera trap buffer, we will measure road density, total forest and grass surface area, and mean vegetation and built up density. **We will use `sf` for all vector data and `terra` for rasters.**

## Import data and get all layers in the same CRS (EPSG:26910)

### Camera and capture data

When we make the spatial data layer, we need to create it with EPSG:4326 because the data are in latitude / longitude. We then transform it to the correct CRS. By chaining together the commands with pipes, we can create our layers in one step without creating intermediate data frames.
```{r}
# Import all captures and set CRS
captures <- read.csv("data/captures.csv") %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude","latitude"), 
           crs = 4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs="EPSG:26910")
```

Get a spatial data frame of all coyote captures that includes locations that have 0 captures.
```{r}
# Create a data frame with all locations
all_locations <- select(captures,locationid) %>% 
  distinct()

# Filter captures for coyotes and summarize by location
# Converting it to a data frame drops the spatial component from one of the data sets
coyote_temp <- as.data.frame(filter(captures, speciesname == "Canis latrans")) %>%
  group_by(locationid) %>%
  summarize(detections = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Left join with all locations to include the locations with 0 captures
coyotes <- all_locations %>%
  left_join(coyote_temp, by = "locationid") %>%
  replace_na(list(detections = 0))
```

### Roads, forest, and grass

```{r}
roads <- st_read("maps/roads/tl_2019_53_prisecroads.shp") %>%
  st_crop(xmin = -122.5, ymin = 47.35,
          xmax = -121.9, ymax = 47.8) %>%
  st_transform(crs="EPSG:26910")
forest <- st_read("maps/Seattle_forest.shp") %>%  # Shapefile already cropped
  st_transform(crs="EPSG:26910")
grass <- st_read("maps/Seattle_grass.shp") %>%  # Shapefile alrady cropped
  st_transform(crs="EPSG:26910")
```

### NDVI and BUILT
```{r}
NDVI <- rast("maps/NDVI_WA.tif") %>%
  project("EPSG:26910") %>%
  crop(forest)
BUILT <- rast("maps/BUILT_WA.tif") %>%
  project("EPSG:26910") %>%
  crop(forest)
LULC <- rast("maps/LULC_WA.tif") %>%
  project("EPSG:26910") %>%
  crop(forest)
```

## Generate buffer areas

```{r}
# Generate buffer areas around camera traps
coyotes_buff <- st_buffer(coyotes, dist=500)
```

## Estimate road density within each buffer area

```{r}
# Intersect buffers with road segments
car.int <- st_intersection(coyotes_buff, roads)
car.int$length.int <- st_length(car.int)

# Sum all road segment lengths in km within each buffer
car.sum <- aggregate(length.int ~ locationid, 
                     data = car.int,
                     FUN = sum) # total length of roads in  buffer
car.sum<- car.sum %>% mutate(car_length_km = round(as.numeric(length.int)/1000)) #convert to km

# Merge road lengths into coyote data
# Convert NA to 0
coyotes_buff <- left_join(coyotes_buff, car.sum, by = "locationid") %>%
  replace_na(list(car_length_km = 0))
```

## Estimate total forest and grass surface area

```{r}
gra.int <- st_intersection(grass, coyotes_buff)
gra.int <- gra.int %>% mutate(grass_area_km2 = as.numeric(st_area(gra.int))/1000^2)
grass_area <- aggregate(grass_area_km2 ~ locationid, data = gra.int, FUN = "sum")
coyotes_buff <- left_join(coyotes_buff, grass_area, by = "locationid") %>%
  replace_na(list(grass_area_km2 = 0))

for.int <- st_intersection(forest, coyotes_buff)
for.int <- for.int %>% mutate(forest_area_km2 = as.numeric(st_area(for.int))/1000^2)
forest_area <- aggregate(forest_area_km2 ~ locationid, data = for.int, FUN = "sum")
coyotes_buff <- left_join(coyotes_buff, forest_area, by = "locationid") %>%
  replace_na(list(forest_area_km2 = 0))
```

## Estimate mean vegetation density (NDVI) and mean building density

It is important to change all NDVI values <0 to NA, as these will bias our estimates for buffer areas near the shore. We also need to create a temporary SpatVector from `coyotes_buff` to `terra` can work with both sets of data. The results of the `extract()` function are vectors in the same order as the `locationid` column, so we will make a new data frame with these results then join it with `coyotes_buff`.
```{r}
coyotes_buff_sv <- vect(coyotes_buff)

NDVI <- ifel(NDVI<0, NA, NDVI)
NDVI_mean <- extract(NDVI, coyotes_buff_sv, fun='mean', na.rm=TRUE)[,2]

BUILT <- ifel(BUILT<0, NA, BUILT)
BUILT_mean <- extract(BUILT, coyotes_buff_sv, fun='mean', na.rm=TRUE)[,2]

raster_means <- cbind.data.frame(locationid = coyotes_buff$locationid,
                                 NDVI_mean, BUILT_mean)

# Don't need to replace NAs because there aren't any in raster_means
coyotes_buff <- left_join(coyotes_buff, raster_means, by = "locationid")
```

## Use your spatial data in downstream analysis

The table `coyotes_buff` now has everything we need to eventually run stats. It has environmental covariates for an occupancy model. Because occupancy modeling is beyond the scope of this tutorial, we'll demonstrate with a couple simple linear models comparing environmental variables to the number of detections. Even though `coyotes_buff` is an `sf` object, we can run statistics directly on it like any other data frame in R.

```{r}
summary(glm(detections ~ BUILT_mean + forest_area_km2, data=coyotes_buff))

summary(glm(detections ~ BUILT_mean, data=coyotes_buff))
```
